# ToDo App
This is the Week 7 Project for Code Fellows - Code 401d52. The aim of this project is to better understand React Context API by using Context to establish & save user settings and authenticate a user before accessing the app.

[Deployed ToDo App](https://kmillerdev-todo.netlify.app)

## Problem Domain

Create an app that can be used to track a list of 'todo' tasks.

The user should be unable to access the app without first signing in.

The user should be able to add, edit, and delete tasks according to their permissions.

The user should also be able to adjust their preferred settings via the `/settings` route.
